# Machine-Learning-Tech
There are examples of how to use Scikit learn to do Machine Learnings and how to use tensorflow to do deep learning.


# 0. Machine Learning Handbook
Basically, there are three categories of machine learning.

* Supervised learning
* Unsupervised learning
* Reinforcement learning

Under supervise learning, there are regression, classification ...

Under Unsuperives learning, there are clustering, GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) ...


Dont forget, for ML algorithm, there are some question should be thought in advance:

* quality of the data?
* how to choose training data, validation data and test data?
* which attribute to choose?
* how to evaluate the model?
* in which situation the algorithm is going to be used, what should be take care of?
