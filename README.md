# Machine-Learning-Tech
There are examples of how to use Scikit learn to do Machine Learnings and how to use tensorflow to do deep learning.


# 0. Machine Learning Handbook
Basically, there is three category of machine learning.

* Supervised learning
* Unsupervised learning
* Reinforcement learning

Under supervise learning, there are regression, classification ...

Under Unsuperives learning, there are clustering, GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) ...

Dont forget, for ML algorithm, there are some advanced question to think:

* quality of the data?
* how to choose training data, validation data and test data?
* which attribute to choose?
* how to evaluate the model?
* in which situation the algorithm is going to use, what should be take care of?
